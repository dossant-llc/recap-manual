## Warranty & Returns

### Warranty Policy

**30-Day Limited Warranty**
- Covers manufacturing defects only
- Valid from date of purchase
- Proof of purchase required

**What's covered:**
- ✅ Hardware defects (device doesn't pass pass-through test)
- ✅ Manufacturing flaws in connectors or housing
- ✅ Electrical failures in RECAP circuitry

**What's NOT covered:**
- ❌ Computer compatibility issues (MONO input, LINE IN, etc.)
- ❌ Headset compatibility issues
- ❌ User damage (physical damage, water damage, phantom power damage)
- ❌ Normal wear and tear
- ❌ Lost or stolen items

### Important: Compatibility vs. Defects

**80% of "not working" reports are compatibility issues, NOT defects.**

Before assuming RECAP is defective, complete the diagnostic checklist:
- ✅ Headset works directly with phone?
- ✅ Pass-through test passes (hear call in headphones)?
- ✅ Device scanner shows MONO? (need USB adapter)
- ✅ Audio gain set to 100%?

**MONO input is not a defect** - it's a computer limitation requiring USB adapter.

### Return Policy

**All sales are final.**

We encourage you to:
1. Check compatibility BEFORE purchasing (device scanner tool)
2. Complete diagnostic tests if issues arise
3. Contact support for troubleshooting before requesting return

**Exceptions:**

## Before You Contact Support

**⚠️ REQUIRED: Complete ALL 5 diagnostic tests BEFORE contacting support**

Without these test results, support cannot help diagnose your issue.

### The 5-Test Diagnostic Checklist

**☑ Test 1: Direct Headset Test**
- [ ] Disconnected RECAP completely
- [ ] Plugged headset directly into phone (via adapter if needed)
- [ ] Made test call to friend or voicemail
- [ ] **Result:** Can you hear them? **YES / NO**
- [ ] **Result:** Can they hear you? **YES / NO**

**If either NO:** Get a different headset before proceeding. RECAP cannot fix incompatible headsets.

---

**☑ Test 2: Pass-Through Test**
- [ ] Connected: Phone → RECAP → Headset
- [ ] Connected separate headphones to RECAP's output jack
- [ ] Made test call
- [ ] **Result:** Can you hear call clearly in headphones? **YES / NO**

**If NO:** Either headset is bad (redo Test 1) or possible RECAP defect.

---

**☑ Test 3: Device Scanner**
- [ ] Visited https://audio.recapmycalls.com
- [ ] Allowed browser to access microphone
- [ ] Took screenshot of results
- [ ] **Result:** Shows STEREO or MONO? **__________**

**If MONO:** USB adapter needed. This is NOT a defect - 80% of modern computers are MONO.

---

**☑ Test 4: Audio Input Gain**
- [ ] Opened computer audio settings
- [ ] Found microphone gain/level control
- [ ] Set microphone gain to **80-100%**
- [ ] Spoke into headset while watching level meter
- [ ] **Result:** Does level meter move when speaking? **YES / NO**
- [ ] **Result:** Current gain setting? **_____% **

**If NO movement:** Wrong input device selected or RECAP not connected to MIC IN.

---

**☑ Test 5: Recording Software Check**
- [ ] Opened recording software
- [ ] Checked input device selection
- [ ] **Result:** What input device is selected? **__________**
- [ ] Verified recording mode is STEREO (not mono)
- [ ] Made 30-second test recording
- [ ] Played back recording
- [ ] **Result:** What do you hear in playback? **__________**
