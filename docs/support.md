## Before You Contact Support

**⚠️ REQUIRED: Complete ALL 5 diagnostic tests BEFORE contacting support**

Without these test results, support cannot help diagnose your issue.

### The 5-Test Diagnostic Checklist

**☑ Test 1: Direct Headset Test**

- [ ] Disconnected RECAP completely
- [ ] Plugged headset directly into phone (via adapter if needed)
- [ ] Made test call to friend or voicemail
- [ ] **Result:** Can you hear them? **YES / NO**
- [ ] **Result:** Can they hear you? **YES / NO**

**If either NO:** Get a different headset before proceeding. RECAP cannot fix incompatible headsets.

**☑ Test 2: Pass-Through Test**

- [ ] Connected: Phone → RECAP → Headset
- [ ] Connected separate headphones to RECAP's output jack
- [ ] Made test call
- [ ] **Result:** Can you hear call clearly in headphones? **YES / NO**

**If NO:** Either headset is bad (redo Test 1) or possible RECAP defect.
