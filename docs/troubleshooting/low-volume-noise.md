### Problem: Low Volume or Faint Audio

**Symptom:** Recording is very quiet, have to turn volume way up to hear

**Solutions (try in order):**

**1. ⭐ MOST COMMON: Audio input gain too low**

This fixes 90% of low volume issues!

- **Windows:**
  1. Right-click speaker icon in taskbar
  2. Select "Recording devices"
  3. Double-click "Microphone"
  4. Go to "Levels" tab
  5. Set "Microphone" slider to **100%**
  6. If there's "Microphone Boost" option, try +20dB

- **Mac:**
  1. System Preferences → Sound
  2. Click "Input" tab
  3. Drag "Input volume" slider all the way to the right

**2. Headset microphone position**

- Boom mic should be 1-2 inches from corner of mouth
- Not directly in front (causes breath noise)

**3. Recording software input level**

- Many programs have their own gain slider
- In Audacity: Input level slider at top (set to 0.8-1.0)

**4. Phone call volume**

- During test call, increase phone volume with buttons
- Affects how loud other person sounds in recording

**5. Weak headset microphone**

- Some cheap headsets have poor quality
- Try different headset (Apple EarPods are good reference)

### Problem: Can't Hear Call in Headset

**Symptom:** No audio in headset during call (but RECAP is connected)

**Diagnostic:**

1. **Test headset directly with phone (no RECAP)**
   - Does it work?
   - NO → Headset is incompatible, get different one
   - YES → Continue to #2

2. **Check connections**
   - RECAP firmly plugged into phone?
   - Headset firmly plugged into RECAP?
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting firmly

3. **Try different headset**
   - Confirms if it's headset compatibility issue

4. **If none of above work**
   - May be RECAP hardware defect
   - [Contact support](../support.md) with test results

### Problem: Static, Noise, or Interference

**Common causes and solutions:**

1. **Loose connections**
   - Ensure all plugs fully inserted
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting firmly

2. **Dirty or damaged connectors**
   - Use compressed air to clean jacks
   - Look for bent pins

3. **Electrical interference**
   - Move RECAP away from power adapters, monitors
   - Don't let cables run parallel to power cords

4. **Microphone gain too high (causing distortion)**
   - Lower gain to 70-80%
   - Look for clipping in waveform (flattened peaks)

5. **Poor quality headset**
   - Some cheap headsets have noisy electronics
   - Try different headset

### Problem: Not Working on Mac

**Most Macs have MONO-only or LINE IN ports**

**Diagnostic:**

1. Run device scanner: <https://audio.recapmycalls.com>
2. Most Macs show MONO only → USB adapter needed

**Mac audio port types:**

- **Combo port** (one port for headphones + mic): Usually MONO only
- **Separate input jack**: Often LINE IN, not MIC IN (incompatible)

**Solution:** Andrea USB stereo adapter - [details here](device-scanner.md)
