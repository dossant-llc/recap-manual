## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is RECAP?**
A: RECAP is a hardware adapter that records both sides of a conversation by splitting headset audio into a stereo signal — your voice on one channel, theirs on the other.

**Q: Do I need special software?**
A: No. Any recording software works (Windows Sound Recorder, Mac QuickTime, Audacity, etc.). We recommend Audacity (free) for best features.

**Q: What devices work as the CALL source?**
A: Any device with a 3.5mm combo headset port (TRRS) — phones, tablets, laptops, even desktops with combo jacks. If your headset works with it, RECAP will work.

**Q: Can I use RECAP with my computer's headset port?**
A: Yes! If your computer has a combo headset jack (common on laptops), you can use RECAP to record Zoom, Teams, or any audio playing through your headset.

**Q: Do I need batteries?**
A: No. RECAP is powered by your computer's microphone bias voltage.

### Compatibility Questions

**Q: Why do I only hear one side of the conversation?**
A: Your computer has a MONO microphone input (captures only one channel). Run the scanner at <https://recapmycalls.com/audio/> to confirm. Solution: USB stereo adapter ($20-40).

**Q: Why doesn't RECAP work with my Mac?**
A: Most modern Macs have MONO inputs or LINE IN ports (not MIC IN). Use the Andrea USB stereo adapter.

**Q: Can I record to my iPhone or Android phone?**
A: Not directly — mobile devices have combo ports, not stereo MIC IN. However, you can use a USB audio adapter (with stereo mic input) connected to your phone's USB-C or Lightning port. This adds a proper stereo input for RECAP.

**Q: Will RECAP work with my computer?**
A: Check compatibility with our free scanner: <https://recapmycalls.com/audio/>. If it shows STEREO input, yes. If MONO, you'll need a USB adapter.

**Q: What's the difference between MIC IN and LINE IN?**
A: MIC IN provides bias voltage to power RECAP and has amplification for microphone signals. LINE IN has neither (RECAP won't work). MIC IN is usually pink, LINE IN is usually blue.

### Setup Questions

**Q: Can I hear the call while recording?**
A: Yes! Connect your headset to RECAP and you'll hear the call in real-time while it records.

**Q: Which headset should I use?**
A: Any headset that works with your phone. Test it first by plugging directly into your phone and making a call. Apple EarPods work well as a reference.

**Q: Why is my recording very quiet?**
A: Audio input gain is almost always the issue. Set your computer's microphone gain to 100%. This fixes 90% of low volume issues.

### Recording Questions

**Q: Can I record to a voice recorder instead of computer?**
A: Yes, if it has a stereo external microphone input. Check your recorder's manual. Must be set to STEREO mode, not mono.

**Q: Can I use RECAP with Zoom, Teams, or Skype calls on my computer?**
A: Yes, if your computer uses a combo headset port (3.5mm TRRS). Connect: Computer → RECAP → Headset, then record to a second device (voice recorder, another computer, or phone with USB audio adapter). Unlike built-in recording features, RECAP doesn't notify other participants that you're recording.

**Q: What recording quality should I use?**
A: For best quality: WAV format, 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth. For smaller files: MP3 at 192kbps or higher.

**Q: Can I record on both sides in separate files?**
A: Yes, in Audacity. Record in stereo, then use "Split Stereo Track" to separate left (your voice) and right (their voice) into separate files.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: My headset works with my phone but not with RECAP. Why?**
A: This is rare but can happen with unusual headset wiring. Try a different headset (Apple EarPods are a good test). If multiple headsets fail, contact support.

**Q: I hear static or noise. What's wrong?**
A: Check all connections are firm. Move RECAP away from power adapters. Lower microphone gain to 70-80%. Try a different headset.

**Q: Can I use a splitter cable to record to multiple devices?**
A: No supported configuration for splitters exists.

### Product Questions

**Q: Is RECAP wireless/Bluetooth?**
A: No. RECAP is a wired hardware adapter. Bluetooth has too much latency for real-time call recording.

**Q: Can I use RECAP with a mixer or recording equipment?**
A: Never use RECAP with +48V phantom power - it will damage the device. For professional equipment, you may need a different interface.

**Q: How long does RECAP last?**
A: RECAP has no batteries or moving parts. With proper care, it should last indefinitely.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What is MONO vs STEREO input?**
A: STEREO input has 2 channels (can record left and right separately). MONO input has 1 channel (records only one side). RECAP requires STEREO to record both sides of conversation.

**Q: What is AHJ standard?**
A: American Headset Jack - the standard headphone connector pinout used by iPhone, Android, and most cell phones. Opposite of OMTP (rare, older phones).

**Q: Why does the scanner show my input as MONO?**
A: Most laptops and Macs made after 2015 have MONO-only inputs to save cost. This is normal. Solution: USB adapter.
