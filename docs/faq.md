## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is RECAP?**
A: RECAP is a hardware adapter that lets you record phone calls on your computer by converting phone headset audio into a stereo microphone signal.

**Q: Do I need special software?**
A: No. Any recording software works (Windows Sound Recorder, Mac QuickTime, Audacity, etc.). We recommend Audacity (free) for best features.

**Q: Does RECAP work with my phone?**
A: RECAP works with any phone that has a 3.5mm headphone jack (iPhone with adapter, Android, etc.). If your current headset works with your phone, RECAP will work.

**Q: Do I need batteries?**
A: No. RECAP is powered by your computer's microphone bias voltage.

### Compatibility Questions

**Q: Why do I only hear one side of the conversation?**
A: Your computer has a MONO microphone input (captures only one channel). Run the scanner at <https://recapmycalls.com/audio/> to confirm. Solution: USB stereo adapter ($20-40).

**Q: Why doesn't RECAP work with my Mac?**
A: Most modern Macs have MONO inputs or LINE IN ports (not MIC IN). Use the Andrea USB stereo adapter.

**Q: Can I record directly to my iPhone or Android phone?**
A: No. Mobile devices have combo ports (headphone + mic combined), not separate stereo MIC IN ports. You need a computer or digital voice recorder.

**Q: Will RECAP work with my computer?**
A: Check compatibility with our free scanner: <https://recapmycalls.com/audio/>. If it shows STEREO input, yes. If MONO, you'll need a USB adapter.

**Q: What's the difference between MIC IN and LINE IN?**
A: MIC IN provides bias voltage to power RECAP and has amplification for microphone signals. LINE IN has neither (RECAP won't work). MIC IN is usually pink, LINE IN is usually blue.

### Setup Questions

**Q: Can I hear the call while recording?**
A: Yes! Connect your headset to RECAP and you'll hear the call in real-time while it records.

**Q: Which headset should I use?**
A: Any headset that works with your phone. Test it first by plugging directly into your phone and making a call. Apple EarPods work well as a reference.

**Q: Why is my recording very quiet?**
A: Audio input gain is almost always the issue. Set your computer's microphone gain to 100%. This fixes 90% of low volume issues.

### Recording Questions

**Q: Can I record to a voice recorder instead of computer?**
A: Yes, if it has a stereo external microphone input. Check your recorder's manual. Must be set to STEREO mode, not mono.

**Q: Can I use RECAP with Zoom or Skype calls?**
A: RECAP is designed for phone calls, not computer-to-computer calls. For Zoom/Skype, use the built-in recording features in those apps.

**Q: What recording quality should I use?**
A: For best quality: WAV format, 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth. For smaller files: MP3 at 192kbps or higher.

**Q: Can I record on both sides in separate files?**
A: Yes, in Audacity. Record in stereo, then use "Split Stereo Track" to separate left (your voice) and right (their voice) into separate files.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: My headset works with my phone but not with RECAP. Why?**
A: This is rare but can happen with unusual headset wiring. Try a different headset (Apple EarPods are a good test). If multiple headsets fail, contact support.

**Q: I hear static or noise. What's wrong?**
A: Check all connections are firm. Move RECAP away from power adapters. Lower microphone gain to 70-80%. Try a different headset.

**Q: Can I use a splitter cable to record to multiple devices?**
A: No supported configuration for splitters exists.

### Product Questions

**Q: Can I return RECAP if it doesn't work with my computer?**
A: All sales are final. Compatibility issues (MONO input) are not defects - they require a USB adapter. We encourage checking compatibility before purchase using our free scanner.

**Q: Is RECAP wireless/Bluetooth?**
A: No. RECAP is a wired hardware adapter. Bluetooth has too much latency for real-time call recording.

**Q: Can I use RECAP with a mixer or recording equipment?**
A: Never use RECAP with +48V phantom power - it will damage the device. For professional equipment, you may need a different interface.

**Q: How long does RECAP last?**
A: RECAP has no batteries or moving parts. With proper care, it should last indefinitely. Warranty is 30 days for manufacturing defects.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What is MONO vs STEREO input?**
A: STEREO input has 2 channels (can record left and right separately). MONO input has 1 channel (records only one side). RECAP requires STEREO to record both sides of conversation.

**Q: What is AHJ standard?**
A: American Headset Jack - the standard headphone connector pinout used by iPhone, Android, and most cell phones. Opposite of OMTP (rare, older phones).

**Q: Why does the scanner show my input as MONO?**
A: Most laptops and Macs made after 2015 have MONO-only inputs to save cost. This is normal. Solution: USB adapter.
