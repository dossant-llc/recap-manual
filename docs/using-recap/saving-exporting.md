### Recording Tips

**Before recording:**
- Close other apps that use microphone (Zoom, Skype, etc.)
- Check input levels (speak and watch meter)
- Make a 10-second test recording first

**During recording:**
- Keep headset mic 1-2 inches from corner of mouth
- Don't touch RECAP device (can cause handling noise)
- Monitor input levels if software shows them
- Avoid loud background noise

**After recording:**
- Listen to first 30 seconds before ending call
- If one-sided or no audio, stop and troubleshoot immediately
- Save in WAV format for highest quality (can convert to MP3 later)
- Backup important recordings to cloud storage

**File formats:**
- **WAV:** Uncompressed, best quality, large files (10MB per minute)
- **MP3:** Compressed, good quality, small files (1MB per minute)
- **Recommendation:** Record as WAV, convert to MP3 for sharing
