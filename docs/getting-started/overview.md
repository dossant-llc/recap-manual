## What You Need

### Required Items

**1. Phone with headphone jack**
- iPhone (with 3.5mm jack or Lightning adapter)
- Android phone with 3.5mm jack

- Test your headset FIRST (see Step 1 below)
- Apple EarPods work well as a reference headset

**3. Computer with STEREO microphone input**
- This is where most issues happen
- Most modern laptops/Macs only have MONO input
