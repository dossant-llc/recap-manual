## What is RECAP?

RECAP is a small hardware adapter that records both sides of any conversation — phone calls, computer meetings, or any audio through a headset.

**What it does:**

- Captures both sides of the conversation (your voice + their voice)
- Works with any device that has a combo headset port (phones, laptops, tablets)
- Outputs to any device with stereo microphone input
- Pass-through audio so you can hear in real-time

**What you get:**

- One channel: Your voice from the headset mic
- Other channel: Their voice from the call device
- ⚠️ Channel assignment (L/R) may vary depending on USB adapter used

**What you need:** Call device + Headset + Recording device + Recording software (free)

- Laptop or computer with combo headset jack
