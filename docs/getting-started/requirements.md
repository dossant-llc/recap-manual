## Compatibility Requirements

### Phone Compatibility

**Compatible:**
- iPhone (with 3.5mm jack or Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter)
- Android phones with 3.5mm headphone jack
- Any phone using AHJ standard connector (most cell phones)

**Not compatible:**
- Phones without headphone jack and no adapter
- Phones using OMTP standard (rare, mostly older European/Asian models)

**How to check:** If your current headset works with your phone, your phone is compatible.

### Headset Compatibility

**Requirements:**
- Must be compatible with YOUR phone
- Standard 3.5mm TRRS connector (4-pole)
- Known-working headsets: Apple EarPods, most phone headsets

**How to test compatibility:**
1. Plug headset directly into phone (no RECAP)
2. Make test call
3. Verify: Can you hear them? Can they hear you?
4. If both YES → Headset is compatible

**Common incompatibilities:**
- Old headsets using OMTP standard (mic/ground pins reversed)
- Headsets designed for different phone brands
- Damaged or worn-out headsets
- PC gaming headsets (often use different connector types)

**⚠️ Important:** Distance of microphone boom to mouth affects volume. Keep mic 1-2 inches from corner of mouth.

### Computer Compatibility

**The Critical Requirement: STEREO Microphone Input**

This is where 80% of compatibility issues occur.

**✅ Compatible:**
- Computers with stereo MIC IN port (2 channels)
- Older Windows laptops/desktops (pre-2015)
- Some desktop PCs with dedicated sound cards
- Computers using USB adapter (Andrea recommended)

**❌ NOT Compatible (without USB adapter):**
- Most modern laptops (2015+) - usually MONO input only
- Most Mac computers - usually MONO input or LINE IN only
- Computers with only LINE IN port (no bias voltage)
- Computers with only headphone/speaker outputs

**How to check:** Visit **<https://audio.recapmycalls.com>** and run the free device scanner.

**Port types explained:**

| Port Type | Compatible? | How to Identify |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| MIC IN (stereo) | ✅ YES | Pink port or mic icon, supports stereo |
| MIC IN (mono) | ❌ NO - need USB adapter | Pink port but only 1 channel |
| LINE IN | ❌ NO | Blue port, no bias voltage |
| Combo port | ❌ Usually MONO | One port for both headphones + mic |
| Headphone OUT | ❌ NO | Green port, output only |

**Solution for incompatible computers:** Use Andrea USB stereo adapter ($20-40)

### Recording Device Compatibility

**Compatible devices:**
- Digital voice recorders with **stereo** external mic input
- Portable recorders (Zoom, Tascam, etc.) with stereo MIC IN
- Professional recorders with stereo line-level input + preamp

**Requirements:**
- Must accept stereo external microphone (2 channels)
- Must provide bias voltage (or use adapter with bias voltage)
- **Not LINE IN** - must be MIC IN or have MIC mode

**How to check your recorder:**
- Look in user manual for "stereo external microphone" support
- Some recorders have mono/stereo switch - must be set to STEREO
- Some have MIC IN / LINE IN switch - must be set to MIC IN

**NOT compatible:**
- Voice recorders with only mono mic input
- Devices with only LINE IN (no bias voltage)
- iPhone/iPad/Android as recording device (combo ports only)

---

### What's NOT Compatible

**❌ LINE IN ports**
- Don't provide bias voltage needed to power RECAP
- Usually blue color or line icon
- Found on: Older desktops, some Macs, stereo equipment

**❌ +48V Phantom Power**
- Professional mixer equipment
- **Will damage RECAP** - never connect to phantom power!
- RECAP designed for computer mic bias only (2V max)

**❌ Mobile devices as recorder**
- iPhones, iPads, Android phones/tablets
- Have combo ports (headphone + mic combined)
- RECAP requires dedicated stereo MIC IN port
- No adapter exists for this configuration

**❌ Splitter cables**
- No supported configuration for using splitters
- Splitters are for different purpose (sharing audio)
